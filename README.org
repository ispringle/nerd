Nerd is the home of my Guix config and also dotfiles. It's called "nerd" for two
reasons, first anyone who creates a repo for their dotfiles or uses Guix for
their system is a nerd by definition. Second it's humorous because Guix is
pronounced "geek".

** Usage

*** Guix

Run a system reconfigure:
#+begin_src shell
sudo guix system -L ~/git/hub/ispringle/nerd reconfigure ~/git/hub/ispringle/nerd/config/systems/$(hostname).scm
#+end_src

Run a home reconfigure:
#+begin_src shell
RUNNING_GUIX_HOME=1 guix home -L ~/git/hub/ispringle/nerd reconfigure ~/git/hub/ispringle/nerd/config/home/base.scm
#+end_src

Once you've stow'd the ~home/~ directory you can also simply run ~update-system~
and ~update-home~.

*** Dotfiles

From the root of this repo just run
#+begin_src shell
stow -t ~ home
#+end_src
